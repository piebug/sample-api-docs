# Introduction

<p class="larger">The <strong>Pumpkin APIe</strong> is about pumpkins and pies and whatever else I feel like. It is also not real.</p>

This is a fake API specification used to test generating and hosting docs using Redocly and GitHub Pages, respectively. After the spec is fully bundled/compiled, I validate it using [Swagger Parser Online](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) to ensure that the compiled spec could be used by various 3rd party tools. 

Here are the other sample APIs:
* [Closet API](closet.html)
* [Fancy API](fancy.html)

Sample `code line` and block:

```javascript
const newVar = 20;
```
